Event Description
Calling all the APAC Hackers!

Join us for a weekend of food and hacking. 'Hack And Snack' is for the foodie in you. Come hack with us this weekend on your favorite projects.

We will be running a fun, activity-filled, open-themed digital hackathon. Feel free to hack on whatever you'd like or make it shark-themed for the fun of it. These events are open to all skill levels, from beginners to the most veteran developers. While we'd love to have you build something on the theme, our themes are only here for inspiration. Please build whatever you'd like and focus on having fun!

If you're from the NA/EU region, we'd love for you to join another one of our amazing hackathons which are more time-friendly for your region: RoboHacks 2

Happy hacking!
